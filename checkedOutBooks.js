// This js will be for CHECKEDOUTBOOKS.HTml
//make it so when we enter an email it will show the books with your email and marked as Checked-Out
//if there are no books with your email, then it will return "your email is not associated with any books"
//if your email is only associated with returned books then it will show the books and say it is returned
//if your have a book checkedout under your email then it will show the book
//next to the checkout book there will be a "return" button and maybe other buttons

//what iM THINKING OF DOING IS MAKING A FOR LOOP THEN DOING arr[i].includes(SCHOOL EMAil)
  //when email entered and the books checkut shows, it will show the Title and the Author
  //on the backend, however, it will also have the books ISBN
  //the reason is because we want to make it so when the return button is pressed..
  //we get the data from the firebase and search it for the book using the associated ISBN
  //once the books code is found, we write the code so that it changes the email associated with that book
  
  //how will we be able to check to see if the book has succesfully being returned
  //i dont want to grab the firebase data once more to confirm that it worked because I feel like it would lag the site
